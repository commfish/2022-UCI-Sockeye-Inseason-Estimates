The R script is modeling for the inseason estimate of UCI sockeye run size. 
Fit inseason OTF data (observed CPUE) to historical run timing curve to select the top 5 historical curves with least mean squared errors; 
Use top 5 models to estimate the acumulative CPUE by end of season;
With updated inseason run sizes and acumulative CPUE to estimate the passage rate;
Estimated total run size is calculated by multiplying acumulative CPUE by passage rate;
Five estimates of total run size wiht five different historical runing curves, which ranked by least mean squared errors.
